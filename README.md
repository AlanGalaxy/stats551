This project explores the use of Bayesian hierarchical regression to analyze wine quality, finding relations between chemical properties and taste scores. Bayesian methods enable efficient learning across wine types, addressing challenges like unequal sample sizes and multicollinearity. Bayes factors model selection is employed to identify the most relevant predictors. Posterior predictive checks confirm excellent model fit, and the results align with frequentist mixed-effects models. The model identifies key predictors of quality, such as alcohol content, residual sugar, and volatile acidity. This study demonstrate the value of hierarchical models in capturing group-level heterogeneity and highlight the important factors in enhancing wine quality.
